This is my assignment 9

it is very incomplete but I have spent over 25 hours in the last 3 days on it.
What I have acheived is making the user's hand and it being fairly random based on the distibution of tile pieces.
The tile pieces are draggable, but i cannot figure out how to make them stick to the droppable spaces they are dragged to.
I have tried to make the individual spaces change image or background image, but to no avail.
This also makes it impossible for me to record what pieces are placed on the board, thus making it unable to add points.
There are two buttons: submit which is incomplete and reset. The intention of submit was to find out what tiles are on the board and add up the points based on tile value and if there was a multiplier.
From what I have now reset works by setting points to  0, and redealing the user a new hand of 7 tiles.

If I could, I would have learned more about the draggable and droppable JQuery widgets, to understand how they accept things that are dragged and dropped.
Another thing I spent meaningless hours is how Javascript treats arrays, I had so much trouble transfering letters from Prof. Heines given array of letter distribution into a JS array. 
If I could restart again, I would not have approached this assignment the way I have.

general checklist of rubric
Basic Functionality
 (4) letter tiles in the player’s “hand” are selected randomly from a data structure with the
proper distribution of the letters (I have done this)
 (4) letter tiles can be dragged-and-dropped onto target Scrabble squares (technically my draggable can be dragged to teh squares, but the interaction is not there :) )
 (4) program identifies which letter tile is dropped onto which Scrabble square (nope)
 (4) board includes bonus squares (nope)
 (4) score is tallied correctly, including consideration of bonus square multipliers (nope)
Additional Functionality
 (3) any number of words can be played until the player wishes to quit (the reset button can used to refresh the game indefinetly)
 (3) the board is cleared after each round so that a new word can be played ( from what I have so far the submit button does clear the board)
 (3) after playing a word, only the number of letter tiles needed to bring the player’s “hand”
back to 7 tiles are selected ( the player will have 7 tiles, just the entire hand is shuffled :) )
 (3) score is kept for multiple words ( point system does not work yet.)
